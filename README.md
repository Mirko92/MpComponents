# Component Library Frameworks and Libraries Comparison

Welcome to my repository dedicated to comparing different implementations of a component library. Currently, I'm exploring the following technologies:

- Angular
- React
- Solid
- Svelte
- Vue
- Qwik

## Project Description

I'm having fun comparing various frameworks and libraries in building components. This project is currently a draft for recreational purposes and may evolve over time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each technology. Within each folder, you'll find the source code related to the implementation of the component library with the corresponding framework or library.


## Notes

This project is in development and may undergo significant changes over time. 
Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.

Enjoy exploring and comparing different technologies!
